    "\n",
    "**A.** The step size is derived from the input arguments `start`, `stop`, and `number` with `numpy.linspace`. If you instead want to supply the step size and derive the number of steps, you would instead use the function `numpy.arange` that takes the input arguments `start`, `stop`, and `number`. `numpy.arange()` differs from Python’s built-in `range()` function which only supports integers and produces a `list` rather than an `array`.\n",
