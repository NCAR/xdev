    "The first used the Python function `readline()` this function only reads a single line from the function and each time you use it, the next line is read. The advantage of this method is that you get to quickly see just the header of the function which is useful for determining how the data is organized. \n",
    "The second method was to use the Python `read()` function, this reads the entire datafile at once, this is preferred over using method 1 for every single line of the file if you in fact want to read in the entire datafile.. \n",
    "And the third method was the same as the second but using the `with` context manager. The advantage of the third method is that when the with-block is completed the file is automatically closed, making for easier clean up and memory usage throughout the script.\n",
