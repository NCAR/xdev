# The Education, Outreach & Community Building Campaign

Education, Outreach and Community Building

## Overview

Success of the Pangeo project has lead to rapid improvement of Python-based
and related tools and technology that can dramatically improve scientific
data analysis.  Since Pangeo is an open community effort, its continued
success depends upon the size and knowledge base of the community, itself.
Hence, we must build and expand the community through education, outreach,
and related community building activities.

## Objectives

- Educate the broader scientific community in the Pangeo platform and ecosystem
- Find and encourage advanced users of the Pangeo platform and ecosystem to
  join the Pangeo developer community and contribute to the core development
  of the Pangeo ecosystem packages

## Example Projects

- Tutorials & Hackathons
- Organizing Pangeo Meetings & Workshops
- Developing education material (videos, etc.)
