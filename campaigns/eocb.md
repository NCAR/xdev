# The Education, Outreach & Community Building Campaign

Education, Outreach and Community Building

## Overview

Success of the Pangeo project has lead to rapid improvement of Python-based
and related tools and technology that can dramatically improve scientific
data analysis.  Since Pangeo is an open community effort, its continued
success depends upon the size and knowledge base of the community, itself.
Hence, we must build and expand the community through education, outreach,
and related community building activities.

As more scientists are trained to use the Pangeo software stack, more potential
contributors to that software stack will arise.  It is important to teach
scientists who are new to Pangeo and the Pangeo stack to be comfortable being
developers, themselves.  We need to be welcoming and supportive as a community,
so that new "users" feel comfortable being "contributors," too.  We need to
be able to teach not only how to use the software itself, but how to program
using best practices, including git, GitHub, and how to contribute to the
community through common communication channels such as GitHub, Discourse, and
through regular open community meetings.

## Vision

As described in the [Xdev Vision Statements](../PURPOSE.md#xdev-vision-statements),
the main goal of the EOCB Campaign is to build a community of more than just
*users* of the Pangeo software stack and platform.  The goal is to build a
community of "contributors" who feel welcome to contribute at any level they
feel comfortable.  This involves many different areas of involvement.

### Education in Software Usage

The first step for many in their journey into Pangeo is learning how to
*use* the software.  Ideally this will be accomplished with both online
educational material including videos, text-based tutorials, live
tutorials, and demonstration Notebooks.

#### Possible Projects

- Add to the Notebook example gallery (https://gallery.pangeo.io)
- Create video tutorials and/or demos
- Live tutorials
- Online, self-paced educational material

### Education in Open Source Development

Learning how to contribute to open source has a broad meaning, ranging
from just simply reporting bugs in a GitHub issue tracker to learning how
to write a pull request to a software package to becoming a core software
package maintainer (including knowing how to prioritize issues, perform
code reviews, etc.).  Users of the software should be encouraged to
give back to the software they use in any way they feel comfortable, and
education should be given to help users get *more* comfortable with
contributing even more.

#### Possible Projects

- Live tutorials
- Online, self-paced educational material
- Organizing hackathons
- Internship mentoring
- Pair programming exercises

### Diversity and Inclusion

For the software to thrive, it is important for the entire open source
community to thrive, and that requires creating a diverse, welcoming
community.  People of any race, gender, sexual orientation, religion,
or any distinguishing characteristic should feel welcome to share their
ideas, contribute to the software stack, mentor, and guide the community
toward achieving important goals.

#### Possible Projects

- Organizing Pangeo meetings (weekly or otherwise)
- Organizing Pangeo workshops (virtual or live)
- Conducting community-wide polling and feedback gathering
- Helping to organize internship programs
