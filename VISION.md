# Xdev Strategic Vision

This document is meant to outline the current vision of the future of
scientific data analysis in the geosciences, and it is meant to lay out
the goals and necessary plans to achieve this vision.  This vision
should be seen as a *forecast* from the Team's perspective, so everyone's
input is welcome.  As the Engineering Lead for the Xdev Team, I do not
see a *single, unified* vision of the future as being possible nor
necessary.  As much as possible, I encourage the team to explore multiple
paths forward on any issue when clear, distinct paths can be developed.

## Xdev Mission Statement

The mission of the Xdev Team is to make possible *interactive* analysis
of large-scale datasets using *open source* software as part of an
international *open source community*.

## Xdev Campaigns

The Xdev Team has two main campaigns that define the scope of our work,
stemming from the Xdev Mission Statement:

1. **Workflows:** scalable tools and platform for performing large-scale
   interactive data analysis efficiently and effectively.  This campaign
   is tied to the first half of the Xdev Mission Statement:

   > The mission of the Xdev Team is to make possible *interactive* analysis
   > of large-scale datasets...

2. **Education, Outreach, Community Building:** teaching scientists how to
   use and contribute back to the open source tools upon which the the
   analysis platform is built.  This campaign is tied to the second half
   of the Xdev Mission Statement:

   > ...using *open source* software as part of an international
   > *open source community*.
