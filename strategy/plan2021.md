# Strategic Plan: 2021

On January 13 and 27, 2021, members of the Xdev Team gathered
virtually to conduct a virtual Start/Stop/Continue strategic
planning exercise.  We endeavor to be open an inclusive in all
that we do, and this exercise is an inclusive method for
determining our strategic prioreties around what we should be
doing and how we should be doing it. During this exercise, the
Team discussed the **Processes** and **Activities** in which we
are, or should be, engaged.  By *Processes*, we were referring
to the way that we operate as a Team.  By *Activities*, we were
referring to the projects that we are (or might) be working on.
Namely, for both Activites and Processes, we created a list of
items distributed across the following subcategories:

- **Start:** What Activities or Processes are we *not* currently
  engaged in that we absolutely *should* be engaged?
- **Stop:** What Activities or Processes are we currently engaged
  in that we should *stop* doing immediately.
- **Continue:** What Activities or Processes are we currently engaged
  in that we should endeavor to continue.

After brainstorming ideas in each category and subcategory above,
each participating member of the Xdev Team was given 15 points to
distribute across *Activities* listed in the *Start*, *Stop*, and
*Continue* subcategories, and each member was given 10 points to
distribute across *Processes* listed in the *Start*, *Stop*, and
*Continue* subcategories.  The results of this exercise are detailed
below.

## Processes: *How we work*

The dominant thread through all of the comments and suggestions that
came out of the *Processes* part of the Start/Stop/Continue exercise
was an overwhelming desire to increase team-wide engagement in all
of our activities and reduce siloing (i.e., eliminate single points
of failure).  Almost all of the brainstorming items from this part of
the exercise can be addressed by creating a more engaged, inclusive,
and welcoming team environment.  This is a very hard problem to solve,
but it is one that we should all take ownership for and strive to
overcome.

I do not suggest that this is the solution, but guided by suggestions
that were made in the exercise, I am going to propose a solution to
this problem that involves imposing a 4-week "Project Cycle" that looks
like this:

- Monday, Week 1: *Project Pitch Meeting* (short)
  - Team Members pitch "project" ideas for the cycle:
    - Need to clearly indicate the desired outcome of the project,
      number of staff ideally needed to succeed in 2 weeks, and
      stakeholders
  - Team Members vote on "project" ideas for the current cycle
    - Select highest voted projects based on staffing available and
      staffing needed (e.g., if 3 projects are pitched with staffing
      needs of 2, 3, and 2, and the team consists of 5 people, then
      only the 2 projects with the highest votes are chosen)
    - Team Members choose which project they want to work on for
      this cycle (equitable selection method, not first-come-first-serve)
    - Team Member(s) who pitched the project are selected as
      "Project Leads"
    - Projects that are not selected for this cycle retain their
      votes for the next cycle (i.e., they don't start with zero
      votes at the next Pitch Meeting)
- *Project Planning* (Remaining Week)
  - Project Leads prepare a "deep dive" session on the necessary
    code, and give pointers to Project Team Members about what code
    they should familiarize themselves with before the "deep dive"
    session (this is hard!!!)
  - Project Leads prepare "Project Specification" documents
- Monday, Week 2: *Project Presentations Meeting*
  - Team Leads go over project specification document, goals and
    point Project Team to code they should get familiar with
- *Team Pre-Learning* (Next 2 Days)
  - Project Team explores and tries to come up to speed with
    material given to them in the Presentation Meeting
- Wednesday, Week 2: *Project Deep Dive Meetings*
  - Project Leads give "deep dive" training sessions to the rest of the
    Project Team
  - Project Leads indicate goals and discuss project plans (i.e.,
    contents of the Project Specificaion document)
  - Project Team Members volunteer for tasks
- *Project Work Cycle* (2 Weeks)
  - Project Leads and Team collaborate on project work, set up necessary
    hack sessions with each other, pair programming, etc.
  - Work proceeds until the work cycle is complete (early completed projects
    can add additional tasks and ammend the Project Spec, projects that
    don't complete just indicate their progress and plans for future)
- Wednesday, Week 4: *Project Summary Meeting*
  - Project Team presents results, conclusions, lessons learned, remaining
    problems to solve and next steps
  - Project Completion Meeting immediately followed by *Project Pitch Meeting*
    on the following Monday

## Activities: *What we do*

Many ideas for projects were given in the *Activities* section of the
Start/Stop/Continue exercise, and many continuing Activities were listed
as high priority.  No Activities were lists in the Stop category, indicating
*to me* that what we feel we need to do most is be more productive.  Hence,
for future reference, I include all of the mentioned activities in prioritized
order by vote count.
