# Strategic Plan: 2021

On January 13 and 27, 2021, members of the Xdev Team gathered
virtually to conduct a virtual Start/Stop/Continue strategic
planning exercise.  We endeavor to be open an inclusive in all
that we do, and this exercise is an inclusive method for
determining our strategic prioreties around what we should be
doing and how we should be doing it. During this exercise, the
Team discussed the **Processes** and **Activities** in which we
are, or should be, engaged.  By *Processes*, we were referring
to the way that we operate as a Team.  By *Activities*, we were
referring to the projects that we are (or might) be working on.
Namely, for both Activites and Processes, we created a list of
items distributed across the following subcategories:

- **Start:** What Activities or Processes are we *not* currently
  engaged in that we absolutely *should* be engaged?
- **Stop:** What Activities or Processes are we currently engaged
  in that we should *stop* doing immediately.
- **Continue:** What Activities or Processes are we currently engaged
  in that we should endeavor to continue.

After brainstorming ideas in each category and subcategory above,
each participating member of the Xdev Team was given 15 points to
distribute across *Activities* listed in the *Start*, *Stop*, and
*Continue* subcategories, and each member was given 10 points to
distribute across *Processes* listed in the *Start*, *Stop*, and
*Continue* subcategories.  The results of this exercise are detailed
below.

## Processes: *How we work*

- Improve team-wide engagement on all of our activities


## Activities: *What we do*

## Start/Stop/Continue Exercise Results

Below are the prioritized results from the Start/Stop/Continue
exercise, in detail.  These are the exact comments there were
gathered during the Start/Stop/Continue exercise.

## Team Processes: *How we work*

Team Processes describe *how* we work as a Team, including how we
organize, how we collaborate, how we communicate, etc.  Next to
each item, I list the prioritization number given by accumulating
the points given to that item from all Team Members.

### Start

These are the Processes that we choose to start doing:

- Pair or shadow programming so we can start learning each other’s codes better [6]
  - How can we improve spin-up time on other people’s projects?
- Hold regular office hours to address questions in Zulip (a time when users know they can get basically real-time responses, perhaps with some 1-on-1 zoom chat if more detail is needed?) [5]
- Conduct semiannual or quarterly team reviews so as to assess team’s progress towards the set goals and/or projects. [5]
  - Need higher frequency of check-ins
  - Can shift team focus more frequently
- Hold regular hack sessions (maybe once every two or three weeks?) to advance Xdev projects / tackle “easy” tickets [4]
  - Easy Column tasks can be done in hack sessions
  - Could be addressed with the pair programming idea above!
- Attempt to keep an eye on identifying stakeholders for different tasks, and make work and priorities more stakeholder-driven.  Include stakeholders in scoping/prioritizing work when possible. [4]
  - Identify stakeholders for each of our projects?
  - Name stakeholders in Project Specs
- Sharing resources to know if we are doing a project that is being done by others [3]
  - e.g., cools things we here about at a conference
  - Consolidate some of our communication channels / docs
- Have repo specific meetings for contributors [2]
  - ...in collaboration with previous bullet

### Stop

These are the Processes that we choose to stop doing:

- Siloing [5]
  - Haiying is the only person who knows about the lossy compression work
  - Anderson is really the only person who knows intake-esm
  - THIS IS A BIG ONE
- Letting meetings be solely a check in (vs a conversation) [4]
  - Make meetings about collaboration rather than accountability
  - Want to hear about the struggles, rather than just the outcomes
  - Meetings can be more effective if we all had an agreed-upon desired outcome
- Comments to PR is ignored [4]
  - Need to be welcoming to each other!
- IT support [2]
  - Lots of people asking for support around the tutorials
  - ...Can we address this with Zulip?

### Continue

These are the Processes that we choose to continue doing:

- Educational Resources (tutorials, notebook gallery, etc.) [6]
- Up stream (xarray, intake, etc.) and peripheral (cf-xarray) contributions [5]
- Reviewing each other’s PRs before merge [4]
- Staying up to date with other Xdevers and their projects [2]
- Adding more documentation (examples, API docs, where to start looking to join a project) [1]

## Team Activities: *What we are doing*

In our own terminology, the Xdev Team's purpose/mission can be
categorized into two different *Campaigns*: *Workflows* and
*Outreach, Education & Community Building*.  We engage in
numerous and diverse projects in both of these spaces.  In the
remainder of this document, an *Activity* could be a single
project or something broad enough to break down in to numerous
smaller projects.

### Start

These are Activities in which the Xdev Team plan to engage in the
next year.  These are Activities that were listed in the *Start*
section of the exercise.

- zulip-FAQ + zulip-chat bot for retrieving answers from the pre-compiled FAQ [8]
- Reach out to other NCAR python users (and gather potential new Xdev members); NCAR python user survey? Presentations to other labs about Pangeo (goal is to get more collaborators) [7]
  - University collaborations to bring in students beyond SIParCS [3]
- A Dokku (http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) service: Allow scientists to deploy live applications/dashboards on NCAR’s hardware [6]
- RDA/DASH Cataloging: [5]
  - RDA-labextension: Jupyterlab extension to interface with RDA via its rest API (https://rda.ucar.ucar.edu/apps)
  - Cataloging RDA (https://rda.ucar.edu/) and DASH (https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/dash) datasets for intake/intake-esm usage
- Dictionary of abbreviations (I'm lost at some points until I take a sec to figure out an acronym, and then I'm behind for a bit on meetings) [4]
- Benchmarking [4]
  - Pangeo stack on new MPI library or HPX
  - Benchmarking on GPUs (Cupy?)
- Jupyterlab-pbs: Jupyterlab extension to interface with PBS [3]
- Jupyterlab-zarr:  Jupyterlab data explorer (viewer) for zarr [3]
- Intake-index: A service that lists available intake catalogs [3]
  - Give a list of “registered intake catalogs”
- Uniform style sheet/linting for languages? (GeoCAT uses yapf-google for python, no linting for legacy Fortran Code) [2]
  - Similar to the above, but a general best-practices page for python development?
  - Black vs yapf-google
- Create a notebook gallery or alternative method for our team to share advanced Python codes and Pangeo codes [2]
- Tools to help transfer data between glade and campaign (e.g. wrappers for globus-cli to help with common transfer patterns)  (What about glade -> stratus too?) [2]
  - https://github.com/NCAR/isd-s3
- Help maintaining conda environments to be shared among collaborators (esp on cheyenne) [2]
  - pangeo metapackage? with CI validation?
- Effort to automate CMIP Analysis Platform updates? [2]
  - Ideally, link with a running service
- Data format standards? (FITS file equivalent for earth sciences?) (netCDF?) [1]
  - CF-conventions?  CMIP6 requirements is the closest…but still not perfect
- Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/ for instant-on examples (useful for seminars and tutorials) (example of demo) [1]

### Stop

There were no items identified as Activities that we need to *Stop* doing immediately
that we haven't already done.
