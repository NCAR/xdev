# Project: {CODENAME}

{Long Project Title}

## Campaigns:

[A project should pertain to one of the identified Xdev Campaigns.  Indicate which
campaigns this project pertains to here.]

- {Campaign1}
- {Campaign2}

## Overview

{Provide a general overview of the project, including background, motivation and justification.
Include any references and citations as you feel necessary in the References subsection.
Attempt to articulate the *requirements* of the project in English.  Critical questions to
address in the overview are:  Why is this project important?  Who will benefit from the
success of this project?  What will make this project a success?}

### References

- {Citation 1}
- {Citation 2}

## Repositories

### Direct

[Most projects are related to work on a specific GitHub repository.  The repository may already
exist, or the repository may need to be created for the project.  In this subsection, provide a
list of repositories that will be *changed* as part of this project.]

- {https://github.com/user1/repoA}
- {https://github.com/user2/repoB}

### References

[A project may also take reference from content in another GitHub repository, but may not
actually do anything *in* that repository.  In other words, the repository may just act as
a reference for work on this project.  List all repositories that might be used as a
reference for this project in this subsection.]

- {https://github.com/user1/repoA}
- {https://github.com/user2/repoB}

## Skills & Knowledge

[The success of the project will depend upon doing specific things to achieve the
deliverables and milestones indicated below.  Those things will require knowledge and
skill.  Some knowledge might only be required for a few deliverables or milestones, and
so any specific skills that might influence the success of those deliverables or
milestones might be considered *optional*.  In this section, indicate what knowledge
and/or skills are required to complete this project successfully.  Indicate which
skills or knowledge is optional.]

- {Knowledge/Skill 1}
- {Knowledge/Skill 2}
- {Knowledge/Skill 3} (Optional)

## Deliverables

[The success of this project will result in *something*, probably more than one *something*,
to be precise.  Those *somethings*, concrete things that are recorded somewhere (e.g., code
on GitHub, documents, video recordings, seminars/lectures/presentations given, etc.) are the
*deliverables* of the project.  In this section, list the deliverables that will be promised
by the success of this project.]

- **{Deliverable 1}:** {Description of deliberable 1.}
- **{Deliverable 2}:** {Description of deliberable 2.}
- **{Deliverable 3}:** {Description of deliberable 3.}

## Milestones

[Think of all of the steps that you need to take toward releasing the deliverables listed in
the previous section.  What all do you have to *do* to achieve that?  In what order?  How long
do you think it will take to do each one of those things?  These are the *milestones*
associated with the project.  Depending on the start date of the project, knowing how long
it will take to accomplish each milestone can give you a *timeline* for the project.

In this section, provide a list of the things that will actually be done to provide
the deliverables promised in the previous section, in the order in which they need to be
done.  Provide these *milestones* in language that is "high-level enough" that specifics can
be determined later.  For example, if you are preparing a tutorial, you probably want to
develop an outline of the tutorial content, then a schedule for the outline contents, then
documents containing material for each section of the tutorial, etc.  You also probably want
to factor in other tasks like announcing the tutorial, making arrangements for rooms,
technology, etc.  Try your best to do this for *your* project idea, milestone by milestone.

As you are doing this, it is good practice to factor in contingency when determining how long
it might take to complete a milestone.  For example, if you think you can devote 8 hours a
week to this project, and if no other complications or problems arose you believed that it might
take you 3 days (24 hours) to accomplish a particular task/milestone, then you probably should
multiply this estimate by 2 to estimate that it should take you 6 weeks to accomplish it!]

1. **{Milestone 1}:** {Description of milestone 1. What will be done? How long should it take?}
2. **{Milestone 2}:** {Description of milestone 2. What will be done? How long should it take?}
3. **{Milestone 3}:** {Description of milestone 3. What will be done? How long should it take?}

## Timeline

[In this section, provide a timeline of the project in terms of the milestones described in the
previous section.]

| Milestone     | Duration  | Deadline     |
|:--------------|:---------:|:------------:|
| {Milestone 1} | {1 month} | {2020-01-10} |
| {Milestone 2} | {1 month} | {2020-02-10} |
