#### Retrospective

- What is working?
  - Some people are charging forward on development!  That's great, and thanks for the wonderful contributions!
  - 
- What isn't working?
  - Some people aren't contributing at all, and I think that's because they are lost and don't know where to start.  I think we need to spend some time focusing on define the common vision for everyone.
