The NCAR Experimental Development (Xdev) Team is a small team of software engineers
dedicated to the advancement and development of modern tools and techniques
in scalable data analysis for geoscientists.  The Xdev Team was created as part
of a collaboration with the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io) community.

Currently, the Xdev Team consists of:

- **Kevin Paul (Team Lead)**: Kevin is a scientist and software engineer at NCAR with a
  specialization in developing parallel Python tools for data post-processing, most recently developing
  tools to post-process the CESM contributions for CMIP6.
- **Matthew Long (Science Lead)**: Matt is a scientist in the Climate & Global Dynamics laboratory
  at NCAR with research foci in Earth system modeling, ocean ecosystems, and biogeochemistry.
- **Anderson Banihirwe** (Tech Lead): Anderson is a software engineer at NCAR with a deep understanding
  of the Python ecosystem, modern software best practices, and modern data analysis.
- **Julia Kent** (Education Lead): Julia has a background in atmospheric and oceanic sciences and
  has recently transitioned into software engineering with a specialty in working with scientists
  to develop Python-based solutions to their workflows.
- **Max Grover** (ESDS Coordinator): Max is a software engineer and data scientist within the
  Climate and Global Dynamics Lab (CGD) here at NCAR. He is working with Matt Long on developing
  climate model evaluation tools and contributing toward the Earth System Data Science (ESDS)
  initiative.
- **Michael Levy**: Mike is a software engineer working on the Community Earth System Model
  (CESM), where his main task is to develop and maintain the
  [Marine Biogeochemistry Library](https://marbl-ecosys.github.io/)
  ([MARBL](https://marbl-ecosys.github.io/)).  Mike has also helped with countless other small
  projects dealing with the CESM infrastructure.
