The NCAR Experimental Development (Xdev) Team is a small team of software engineers
dedicated to the advancement and development of modern tools and techniques
in scalable data analysis for geoscientists.  The Xdev Team was created as part
of a collaboration with the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io) community.

Currently, the Xdev Team consists of:

- **Kevin Paul (Engineering Lead)**: Kevin is a scientist and software engineer at NCAR with a
  specialization in developing parallel Python tools for data post-processing, most recently developing
  tools to post-process the CESM contributions for CMIP6.
- **Matthew Long (Science Lead)**: Matt is a scientist in the Climate & Global Dynamics laboratory
  at NCAR with research foci in Earth system modeling, ocean ecosystems, and biogeochemistry.
- **Anderson Banihirwe**: Anderson is a software engineer at NCAR with a deep understanding
  of the Python ecosystem, modern software best practices, and modern data analysis.
- **Julia Kent**: Julia has a background in atmospheric and oceanic sciences and has recently
  transitioned into software engineering with a specialty in working with scientists to develop
  Python-based solutions to their workflows.
- **Brian Bonnlander**: Brian is a computer scientist with a specialty in machine learning and
  a strong motivation to provide high-level tooling to provide high-level data analysis tools
  that allow scientists to focus on science, rather than software engineering.
- **Michael Levy**: Mike is a software engineer working on the Community Earth System Model
  (CESM), where his main task is to develop and maintain the
  [Marine Biogeochemistry Library](https://marbl-ecosys.github.io/)
  ([MARBL](https://marbl-ecosys.github.io/)).  Mike has also helped with countless other small
  projects dealing with the CESM infrastructure.
- **Mohammad Abouali**: Moe is a computational scientist working as a software engineer at NCAR on the 
  [GeoCAT](https://geocat.ucar.edu/) team, assisting with the "Pivot to Python" NCL effort.
  Moe has a strong background in software engineering in the private sector and has a
  deep understanding of modern software best practices.
