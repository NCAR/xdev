More than a year ago, [Matthew Long](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/mclong/) and 
[I](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/kpaul) started shopping around the idea that a lot of what 
we do here at [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), as well as *how* we do it, needed a modern 
overhaul.  Our pitch was simple: As an institution that supports the geoscientific community
by providing valuable datasets, supercomputing facilities, and computer models, we need to
_exemplify_ modern best practices in the development and use of these resources.  We took
guidance from remarkably effective communities like [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io), which continues
to show the enormous potential of Open Source development when coupled with modern software best
practices, and we started to develop a plan of how to shift, albeit slowly, both NCAR and the
geoscience community toward a better future.

To implement our plan, Matt and I started to see how much benefit to NCAR it could be to have 
a small, Agile team that was dedicated to prototyping new technologies for the benefit of the 
rest of the organization and the rest of the geoscience community, as a whole, like the 
[UK Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)'s [Informatics Lab](https://www.informaticslab.co.uk/).
However, instead of just churning out technology, this group could also serve as an example to 
the rest of NCAR on how (and why) to use modern best practices (GitHub, continuous integration, 
test-driven development, etc.) for scientific software development.  ...and for science itself!

Matt and I dreamed big, and as usually happens when the reality of budgets collides with dreams, 
we were forced to scale back our vision of a ten-person team to small group of two.
Two is still greater than zero, so we considered that a success, and the Experimental Development
Team (Xdev) was born!  In October of 2018, [Anderson Banihirwe](https://andersonbanihirwe.dev/)
joined the team from NCAR's Computational & Informatics, and in January 2019, Julia Kent joined.
