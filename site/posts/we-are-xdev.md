More than a year ago, [Matthew Long](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/mclong/) and 
[I](https://staff.ucar.edu/users/kpaul) started shopping around the idea that a lot of what 
we do here at [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), as well as *how* we do it, needed a modern 
overhaul.  Through interactions with amazingly effective organizations like [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io),
Matt and I saw the enormous potential of Open Source development, coupled with modern Agile management 
practices.  Frankly, it was mesmerizing to see what these best practices could achieve *when 
done right*.

Matt and I started to see how much benefit to NCAR it could be to have a small, Agile team that
was dedicated to prototyping new technologies for the benefit of the rest of the organization, like
the [UK Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)'s [Informatics Lab](https://www.informaticslab.co.uk/).
However, instead of just churning out technology, this group could also serve as an example to the rest
of NCAR on how (and why) to use modern best practices (GitHub, continuous integration, test-driven
development, etc.) for sceintific software development.    

Matt and I dreamed big, and like usually happens when the reality of budgets collides with dreams, we
were forced to scale back our vision of a ten-person team to small group of two.  We considered that a
success, though, and the Experimental Development Team (Xdev) was born!  In October of 2018, 
[Anderson Banihirwe](https://andersonbanihirwe.dev/) joined the team, and in January 2019, Julia Kent joined.
