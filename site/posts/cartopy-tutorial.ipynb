    "- If you already have Jupyter working correctly in an environment (perhaps called `jupyter_tutorial`) from your personal use or a past tutorial in this seminar. Activate it with `conda activate ENVNAME`. Then check that you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, AND `cartopy` installed with `conda list`. If installation is necessary, type `conda install matplotlib numpy cartopy` (or a subset of these packages, i.e. `conda install cartopy`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you do not have a Jupyter-ready tutorial (i.e. you did not attend the previous tutorials), create one with all of the necessary packages for the session on `cartopy` with `conda create --name cartopy_tutorial jupyterlab numpy matplotlib cartopy`.\n",
