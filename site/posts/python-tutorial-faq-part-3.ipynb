    "\n",
    "One should note that Python 2 does not behave this way.  In Python 2, the `//` operator does not exist and the `/` operator behaves like it does in other languages (i.e., division of two integers yields an integer and division with a float yields a float).\n",

    "**A.** Functions can be defined in any order. If you have a function above that calls a function defined below, it will work. But if you just call the function above its definition, it will fail. We recommend having a separate file that contains all the functions or helper functions - we will cover this in the “Your First Python Package” section.\n",

    "\n",
    "**A.** In general, yes.  If you create a variable in your function scope that has the same name as a variable in global scope, you will not be able to access the global scope variable from within the function. But everything would be fine in global scope.\n",
    "In your example, however, it would be fine.  The `t` and `v` variables in function scope will not overwrite the `t` and `v` (in your example) that are in global scope within the `for` loop.\n",

    "**Q.** Will all the variables being created within a function still occupy the memory after the function was finished?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.** Python uses garbage collection for memory management. That means that those variables will no longer be referenced anywhere, so they will be cleaned up whenever garbage collection happens which is not necessarily after the function return or during the execution of your script as long as there is no reason to clear memory. Essentially garbage collection is complicated, and controlling memory with Python is a hard thing to do.\n",
