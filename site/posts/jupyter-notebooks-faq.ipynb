It is possible to have a ton of duplication (e.g., every single user of the virtual environment has installed `numpy`) but this gives you a lot of control over your own software versioning. You can prune unused virtual environments to save disc space with the command `conda env remove —name my_env`, or try `conda clean -a` to clean up any cached downloaded packages.\n",
