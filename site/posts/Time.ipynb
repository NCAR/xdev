    "Lately, I’ve been working on a project that compares modeled and measured data, which is pretty standard. The measured data is on a Gregorian calendar (meaning there are leap years), and the modeled data is on a 365-day no-leap calendar. This is a pretty standard occurrence, so there are tools available in pandas and xarray to help. But if only I could express the depth of my frustration navigating these tools. "

    "At several moments I seriously considered writing my own functions to deal with date time. When I talked to some of my friends (who are scientists about it), they confessed to me that they had each written their own function for dealing with this. This is a problem. One of the tenants of the Pangeo community is making it so scientists aren’t all repeating the same work when encountering similar problems. I couldn’t write my own function for time, it was my job to demonstrate how to use the tools already approved by the Pangeo community. But it felt like all of the tools worked differently in different scenarios. I had to navigate the documentation to figure out the when and why of time. "

    "Essentially my data is in two distinct conventional ways of formatting time: datetime64 and cftime. Both of these methods have different benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data is initally in float64, which Xarray can automatically decode for me based on the time units and bounds supplied. For the modeled data, which is on a calender with no leap years, only cftime is supported. For the measured data, on a real Gregorian calendar, time is converted to datetime64 format. So I need my data to be in the same format, but which one to pick?\n",

    "Sometimes I want datetime. At one point I want to split my modeled dataset into two groups: an early piece that matches the time bounds from the measured data, and a future piece that includes all of the model yet to occur and to be bias-corrected. This is done with the `dataset.sel(time = slice(a, b))` where a and b are the first and last time point from the measured dataset **in datetime64 formatting!**\n",

If I am in datetime64 formatting, but with February 29th missing, this function spans 366 days for every year, instead of 365, and this error grows with every additional year of data (suddenly March 1st is averaged with March 2nd from the next year, for example). **So I need my time coordinate to be in cftime.DatetimeNoLeap formatting.**\n",

    "    ds = ds.swap_dims({'time': 'time_dt'})\n",
    "    assert len(da.time) == len(ds.time_dt)\n",
