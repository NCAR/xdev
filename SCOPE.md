# Xdev Strategic Plan

This document is meant to outline the current vision of the future of
scientific data analysis in the geosciences, and it is meant to lay out
the goals and necessary plans to achieve this vision.  This vision
should be seen as a *forecast* from the Team's perspective, so everyone's
input is welcome.  As the Engineering Lead for the Xdev Team, I do not
see a *single, unified* vision of the future as being possible nor
necessary.  As much as possible, I encourage the team to explore multiple
paths forward on any issue when clear, distinct paths can be developed.

## Xdev Mission Statement

Xdev exists to improve *both* the technology that geoscientists use to analyze
large-scale datasets *and* the relationships they have with the engineers who
develop that technology.

## Xdev Vision Statements

We see two unique aspects of the future, described by two complimentary
vision statements, with each vision of the future pertaining to one of the
two elements in the Xdev Mission Statement:

1. We envision a future where scientists can interactively analyze datasets of
   *all* sizes, no matter where the datasets are stored, and be able to share
   their analyses easily and reproducibly.

2. We envision a future where scientists are more than just *users* of technology,
   but that they are *members* of an open source community comprised of scientists
   and engineers who work together to improve and develop technology.

### Xdev Campaigns

The Xdev Team has two main campaigns that define the scope of our work,
stemming from the two Xdev Vision Statements:

1. **Workflows:** scalable tools and platform for performing large-scale
   interactive data analysis efficiently and effectively.  This campaign
   is tied to the first Xdev Vision Statement.
   See [campaigns/workflows.md](campaigns/workflows.md)

2. **Education, Outreach, Community Building:** teaching scientists how to
   use and contribute back to the open source tools upon which the the
   analysis platform is built.  This campaign is tied to the second Xdev
   Vision Statement.
