# Xdev Project Specifications

All past, current, and future projects and project planning documents for the Xdev Team
can be found in the `projects/` folder.  This folder is meant to contain our project plans
and team efforts.

First, let's define the term *project*, in this context.  ***Projects*** are concerted
efforts with a few *measurable* goals that span only a few months of work (i.e., a quarter
of a year).  *Projects* are meant to be small enough in scope and commitment to see the
"light at the end of the tunnel."  That is, it should be clear when defining a project what
the outcome should be before starting any work.

Projects should be distinguished from ***Operations***.  *Operational* work pertains to
day-to-day activities that *do not have a defined deadline*.  That is, *operations* can
include responding to questions from scientists or users of our tools and utilities.
*Operations* can include work to stay up-to-date on technology, such as reading blogs,
following issue trackers, etc.  In simple terms, *operations* are the stuff we do every
day just because its required to do a good job on our projects, but may not directly
impact or even be associated with an existing project or campaign.

The `projects/` folder is meant to help organize and plan our *project* work.  The intent
is for each project to be described by a single document, a *Project Specification*
document.  A template for this document exists in the `projects/development/` directory.

## Contents

- **`projects/`**: This directory contains all project-related specifications and
  templates.

  - **`projects/active/`**: All project specification documents for on-going (active)
    projects should be placed here.
  - **`projects/complete/`**: All project specification documents for completed
    projects should be placed here.
  - **`projects/development/`**: All project specification documents for projects
    that are still being constructed/specified should be placed here.  This includes
    projects that are waiting to start (and, therefore, don't have milestone dates
    defined, yet).
  - **`projects/development/projspec_template.md`**: A template for *Project Specification*
    documents.  When a new project is defined/specified, it should be named
    `projspec_{codename}` where `{codename}` is replaced by the project codename.
