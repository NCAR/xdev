# Xdev Processes

In this document, I will try to detail the processes that we, as a team,
should always follow.  I encourage others to add "rules" and suggestions
for process to this document as described below.

## Communication

Other than in-person communications, we use 3 platforms for our team
communications.  Preference should be given to GitHub, then Zulip, and
lastly email.

- **Use GitHub for all communication, when possible.**  The idea is that
  there should be one best method for communication with the team.  This
  method should be _open_ for all to read, so that others can not only
  see our final work products, but so that others can know how we got to
  those products, too.  This includes the following:

  - Indicate what you are working on (or going to work on in the future)
    by creating GitHub Issues that are cross-referenced in Pull Requests.
  - When discussing work being done or details of technical work,
    communicate with other team members through comments on their
    GitHub Issues.
  - When you need to get someone's attention on GitHub, you should
    @-mention them explicitly.  (This also implies that everyone should
    set their [GitHub notification preferences](https://help.github.com/en/github/receiving-notifications-about-activity-on-github/choosing-the-delivery-method-for-your-notifications)
    to notify you in a way that will not be lost or missed.)

- **Use Zulip for all other electronic communication.**  The idea here is
  that our communication with each other should be recorded somewhere.
  Zulip allows us to record our _quick_ chat-like communications, too.
  Zulip is good for communication that is short and needs a rapid turn-around.
  For longer discussions and less urgent communication, use GitHub.  Try
  to avoid too many private messages, preferring to communicate in the open,
  but private messages (and email) are good for some things.

- **Use Email sparingly.**  Email is useful for some forms of communication.
  For example, email is the only form of communication with someone who is not
  on GitHub (or is not a developer, and therefore does not and cannot be 
  expected to follow GitHub) or does not have an account on our Zulip server.
  For some forms of communication with the team, such as notifications of
  being out of the office or similar, email is fine for this (and it is
  easy since it simply involves CCing the xdev@ucar.edu mail alias).

- **Be nice!!!**  This is a no-brainer.  We are all busy, and we all have
  stresses in our life that come from outside of our work lives, _in addition_
  to the stresses that come from work itself.  Always be cognizant of this fact,
  and be kind and compassionate to each other and to others that we work with.
  Kindness makes everyone's job easier.

## Work Process

As open source developers, all of our work should be done in an _open space_.
This means GitHub and in associated Git repositories.
